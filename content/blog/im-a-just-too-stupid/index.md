I'm filled with negative emotions. Emotions that I hide under the pretense of being busy and overworked. Pushing over 80 working hours a week, living at the office, and

I feel unbearable sadness about what I've done in the past. About things I know I can't change. I go to bed every night hoping that tomorrow some scientists out there invents the time tomorrow. I day dream about amnesia, of being able just forget everything. I fantasize about things just working out by themselves. But they never do. No amount reflection will mend the relationships my action have broken. New hobbies and interests will never saturate ones mind to drown sorrows.

I'm not afraid to face the ghosts of my past, I'm just uncapable of coming to terms with them.
