When we started Nyxo our only board member where Eeva and I. After some time we also added a two minority share holders. With my previous company we had a similar ordeal. We started out with the board consisting of just the founders. We didn't really have board meetings, so I would go even go so far as to say that we didn't really have a board, at least not one that would have been of any use.

Two years into the that company
