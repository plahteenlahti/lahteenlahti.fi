#### Our best stories from the crazy world of hackathons

A bit over a year ago when we founded Perfektio, competing in hackathons was just something we did because of how fun it is. Itâ€™s hard to consider them as a goldmine for anything (expect for hoodies and other swag). Sure, sometimes new startups and products are born from hackathons, but building a viable business around them sounds quite ludicrous.

> Building a viable business around hackathons sounds ludicrous.

Somehow, a year later, weâ€™ve done just that. Not by accident, of course. It all actually started as a series of experiments. We moved from one hackathon to another, constantly testing a new hypothesis. Hack Reports were born from the desire to but the results into writing.

Weâ€™ve had fun writing and hope youâ€™ve had fun reading them. We have another article coming up that focuses purely the analysis of this yearâ€™s hackathons, but in the meantime you hereâ€™s the best Hack Reports of this year.

### [TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin Hackathon](https://medium.com/perfektio/hack-report-techcrunch-disrupt-berlin-hackathon-8b4e44288fe8)

_Is it possible to develop a complete app in 20 hours even if you fuck up really bad?_ ðŸ¤”

This yearâ€™s last Hack Report tells a story of success and failure in the world famous hackathon of TechCrunch Disrupt. Written by our very own Jonne Huotari this is one really interesting read on how to build the best app for motivating marathon runners with personal voice messages.

### [Kuohu Creative Hackathon](https://medium.com/perfektio/hack-report-kuohu-creative-hackathon-4854d73edf66)

_This yearâ€™s best hackathon_

Weâ€™re starting the list with this yearâ€™s best hackathon (in our opinion, sadly there are no official awards for hackathons. Yet). [Luova Aalto](https://medium.com/u/df9053afb132) really set the bar high with this hackathon, which was slightly different from the ones weâ€™re used to seeing. If youâ€™re organizing a hackathon, read this to understand how to do it well.

### [Hack theÂ Law](https://medium.com/perfektio/hack-report-hack-the-law-5edaaf294a64)

_I hacked the law, and I won_

In Hack the Law we worked together with law students and had a lot of fun tinkering with the accessibility of law services. This is also our first Hack Report which talks about team building, a subject we hope to talk more about in the future, as itâ€™s something weâ€™re finally starting to fully understand.

### [Talking Plants withÂ Fiskars](https://medium.com/perfektio/hack-report-talking-plants-with-fiskars-c71be389e6ea)

_Gardening is freakinâ€™ cool_

The first Industryhack hackathon we reported about was gardening, and event itself was nothing short of an amazing. In 2017 we actually took part in 9 Industryhack hacks and ended up winning 5 of them. Most of these hacks have lead to pilot projects and in the coming year you will get a taste of those projects and the Hack Reports concerning them. In the meantime, read have we hacked gardening.

### [Oulu 5GFWD](https://medium.com/perfektio/hack-report-oulu-5gfwd-hackathon-510445e858e7)

_Virtual classrooms, hospital experiences, and factories of tomorrow_

Our first Hack Report was about Oulu 5GFWD and how weâ€™re able to use dynamic teams to solve multiple problems simultaneously. Hack Reports were still taking their shape at this point as well as our way of working, so this report is also a good view on where we started from.

### [I hack, therefore IÂ am](https://medium.com/perfektio/i-hack-i-die-i-hack-again-de5ab6caf50a)

_The adverse effects of attending hackathons_

Now this here isnâ€™t an official Hack Report nor a definitive look at any particular hackathon. Despite this Iâ€™ve decided to include it, as it reflects on the emotional and motivational context of hackathons quite a lot better than our other articles. Some parts of the text might feel a bit bitter, and to be honest, I poured a lot of my frustration of that time into this text, but itâ€™s still a decent read on subjects not that often talked about in hackathon context.

### Last words

In the year 2018 we plan to continue what we started with Hack Reports. However the focus is going to change a little, thereâ€™s going to be a lot more content, and hopefully a lot more writers. The experimentation however is not going to stop but instead become a even bigger part of our hackathon strategy.
