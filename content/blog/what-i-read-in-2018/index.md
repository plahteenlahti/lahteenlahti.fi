**The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal by [@benmezrich](https://twitter.com/benmezrich) ⭐️⭐️⭐️** Reads more like a fiction book, but is still a decent look at the founding of Facebook. If you've seen The Social Network movie, you might not get much out of this.

**Venture Deals by [@bfeld](https://twitter.com/bfeld)** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐ Perhaps the best guide on how venture funding works and you should approach it if you're an entrepreneur. Helps you understand stuff like term sheets, convertible loans, and dilution. 5/5 will read again.

**Norse Mythology by [@neilhimself](https://twitter.com/neilhimself)** ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐ Greek mythology used to be the thing I loved to read about, but after reading this books I'm definitely more in love with Norse mythology and the crazy stories about Loki, Thor, and Odin. Like reading campfire stories.

**Enkeleitä** ja yksisarvisia **– Startup-Suomen tarina by Tuomas Vimma** ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Wouldn't call it a good book, but it's the only one there is about the birth of the Finnish startup ecosystem. Pair this with Kutsuvat sitä pöhinäksi.

**Vox by [@CVDalcher](https://twitter.com/CVDalcher) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Set in an alternate future where women can only speak 100 words a day. The cognitive scientist & scifi lover in me loved this book.

**It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work by [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** One of the most valuable books I've read this year. Strategic guide to building 'the calm company', an approach that reduces chaos, anxiety and stress at your workplace.

**Lab Rats: How Silicon Valley Made Work Miserable for the Rest of Us by [@realdanlyons](https://twitter.com/realdanlyons) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐** Last year I read Disrupted, which changed the way I looked at SV startups. Lab rats did the same and changed the way I think about lean startup, agile, and the modern way of working.

**I Hate the Internet by Jarett Kobek ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Feels almost like reading a novel about Silicon Valley written by Kurt Vonnegut. Loved this book for its endless one-liners and how it shows no mercy for silicon valley.

**Lost and Founder: The Mostly Awful, Sometimes Awesome Truth about Building a Tech Startup by [@randfish](https://twitter.com/randfish) ⭐⭐️⭐️⭐⭐** The best book I've read this year, hands down. This book should read by everyone working on a startup or thinking about founding/joining one.

**Paranoid Optimist by [@rsiilasmaa](https://twitter.com/rsiilasmaa) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Probably the best depiction of why Nokia lost the mobile phone war, and how it was able to redeem itself after it. Also an excellent look at how a well functioning board should work.

**Blackfish City by [@sentencebender](https://twitter.com/sentencebender) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** One of kind scifi novel with Orcamancers and floating cities. Starts slowly, but picks up speed after and in the end I was hoping it would have lasted a little longer. Also the best looking book cover ever.

**Springfield Confidential: Jokes, Secrets, and Outright Lies from a Lifetime Writing for The Simpsons by [@MikeReissWriter](https://twitter.com/MikeReissWriter) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Not a huge Simpsons fan, yet enjoyed this book a lot. Really good (and sarcastic) look at how Simpsons is made, but also how comedy writing works.

**Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys' Club of Silicon Valley by [@emilychangtv](https://twitter.com/emilychangtv) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Book that should be read by everyone working in tech, to understand why it consists of mostly white males, how it got that way, and what should be done to fix it.

**The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups by Randall E. Stross ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Read this while I was applying to [@Ycombinator](https://twitter.com/Ycombinator) and it was a really eye-opening on how the most prestigious accelerator in the world works.

**Crush It!: Why Now Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion by [@garyvee](https://twitter.com/garyvee) ⭐️⭐️⭐️** I've never really understood the hype surrounding Gary Vaynerchuk or the so called struggle porn.

**Rework by [@jasonfried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) & [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐** A book every founder should read at some point, just to understand that workaholism and long hours are not a sign of a good company nor a founder. You can read this book in an afternoon.

**Furiously Happy: A Funny Book About Horrible Things by [@TheBloggess](https://twitter.com/TheBloggess) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** I actually picked up this book just because of its cover (you have to see it), but ended up loving everything in it.

**Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die by Chip Heath, Dan Heath ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Guide to making ideas and things to stick. Changed the way I think about copywriting and pitching. Pair this with Contagious.

**Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness by [@R_Thaler](https://twitter.com/R_Thaler), [@CassSunstein](https://twitter.com/CassSunstein) ⭐️⭐️⭐️** If you've read Thinking fast and slow, and like behavioral economic, you should read this book. Short book but filled with different cases of nudging.

**Dear Founder: Letters of Advice for Anyone Who Leads, Manages, or Wants to Start a Business by [@maynard](https://twitter.com/maynard) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Most likely the best collection of advice every startup founder needs. Keep it on your desk and consult when you come across problems.

**Work for Money, Design for Love by [@DavidAirey](https://twitter.com/DavidAirey) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Wish I had come across this book when I started my first business. It has all the answers to starting and running a successful design business.

Demystifies startup buzz. Wish there had been something like this when I was in high school.

**Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All by [@kelleybros](https://twitter.com/kelleybros)⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** A book about how everyone can be creative. Highly informative yet really fun to read. You should definitely read this if you don't see yourself as a creative person.

**Startup Studio Playbook by [@aszig](https://twitter.com/aszig) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** Wish this book was longer, because the subject is so interesting. I think this is the only book about this subject? Gives a pretty good look at the current startup studios and how they work.

**Bank 3.0 - Why Banking is No Longer Somewhere You Go, But Something You Do by [@BrettKing](https://twitter.com/BrettKing) ⭐️⭐️⭐️** There's already a version 4.0 out of this book, which is probably more timely. Still a pretty good read, and as a former analyst at a bank, this book had me nodding at several points.

**The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon by [@BradStone](https://twitter.com/BradStone) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Captivating story of Amazon and Jeff Bezos. Found this book really valuable because of dives into the culture and ways of working at Amazon.

**Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Classic self-improvement book. The age of the book shows a little, and the book ends up being a weird combination of both relevant advice and some really funny pseudoscience stuff.

**The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐** The classic book on value investing that everyone interested in investing should read just to understand the basis of value investing. Book is better towards the end.

**Hacking Growth: How Today's Fastest-Growing Companies Drive Breakout Success by [@SeanEllis](https://twitter.com/SeanEllis) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Still pretty much the best book about growth hacking.

**The Startup Way: Making Entrepreneurship a Fundamental Discipline of Every Enterprise by [@ericries](https://twitter.com/ericries) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** If **_Lean Startup_** is must read for every startup founder, then this a for the people working in large corporations.

**Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt by Michael Lewis ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Michael Lewis never let's down. Great book about high-frequency trading. You would expect a book about stock trading to be boring but this is far from it.

**Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything by Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐** Even if you don't like economics you should consider reading this book. If for nothing else, then just for the conversations starters you can get out of it.

**Good Strategy/Bad Strategy: The difference and why it matters by Richard P. Rumelt ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐️** Great book about strategy, without all the unnecessary bullshit. Read this book and learn the real meaning of word strategy and also how to use it.
