I've been working as a developer for past six years, but being a developer was never something that I set out to do. As I've written before, I started coding relatively late, and mostly because coding was something I had to pick up to better sell myself in something I actually wanted to do: design.

You see I've always oriented towards design. Back when every teenagers was intensly focused on how to get their moped to run 10km faster, I've was more interested on visual aspect of mopeds. I took up painting, and learned use maaliruisku, putting a lot of my teenage money into learning a skill I would never use the moped phase passed (car paints are not cheap, especially the special ones like candy paints and chameleon paints).

Similar thing happened with my studies. I set out to study cognitive neuroscience, but become enarmored with cognitive ergomics which then lead to usability, user interfaces and UX design. For year I tried to combine these two things, and worked as a research assistant in group focusing on computational design of user interfaces, dreaming that maybe I could become a researcher and research design with a cognitive science twist.

## The Pareto Op

Eventually, after working on various smaller projects where I had had the chance to improve both my profiency in designer's tools such Sketch and a number of prototyping tools, my visual eye for designing good looking user interfaces, and user interview skills, I by pure chance came across person who wanted to hire me to do exactly those things. I was happy, I would finally be a real designer. However there was a twist:

Part of this job would also be development with Java.

At that point I had maybe one year worth of knowledge in Java, which were all the result of taking the only two beginner level courses my university provided, and building one school project with Java. So even though the idea of selling a skill I had very little experience with sounded very scary, I decided to took up on the chance because I would also finally get to do real design work. More than four people would be using something I had designed, and maybe they would even think that some of the design was good.

And so I took leap into the world of software development and consulting. I was hired as contractor, with two other people, who had years more experience than I had and came from a large consultancy agencies themselves. I still remember the first team lunch we had, we these two tried to question about my previous projects, how long I had been developing with Java, and what did I think of some of the technical choices of the projects. I managed to avoid most of the embarrasment that my novice skills could have caused by saying that I'm also going to work on the design of the project. That ended the barrage of questions, with both of them remarking that they had never worked in a project where there was a designer that would also code.

During my time there I evolved both as a designer and a developer. However on relative scale my evolution to a decent developer was much quicker, and took larger leaps. Partly this is because the my whole workload in that project seemed to follow a weird pareto optimality. 20% of my time would be spent doing design work, and 80% doing development work. Despite this 80% of praise I got, and 80% of the things that objectively made the product better came from the design work I did. Partly this is because skillwise I was closer to junior level developer, while in design I was considered approaching seniority.

### Startups

## Further experimenting

Last year I decided to run a quick experiment on how recruiting developers and designers differ. I applied to two different consultancy agencies, to two different roles: software engineer and UX designer. I got accepted to both of the positions, but it was clear in which role I was valued more: the software engineering one. There were other interesting points as well:

- I spent way more time on design assignment,than on coding assignment. Compared to the coding assignment the design assignment was a lot harder, required more thinking and problem solving skills, and
- For the software engineering position I was offered a higher salary than I asked
- For the UX design position I was given
