I've been chronically unhappy with the direction of my life for the last seven years. Or at least I think so. I'm quite sure when this all started. It could have been the day mom left to commit suicide. It could also have been going longer than that. I guess it doesn't matter anymore. But out courtesy I will try to give at least some type of closure.

I used to think that if I were to die one day, there would more people who hated me than those who loved me. But as years have passed by, all the feuds have lost their meaning, their power. So I'm guessing there's not going to that many people who hate me when this goes out. However, I'm guessing there's going to be many people who couldn't give rats ass about me leaving this world, some might even be happy. If anyone of them ever comes across this, I just want to say I'm sorry. As crazy as it might sound, especially when looking at my past actions, my intention was to never to deliberately hurt anyone. I was just really bad at co-existing with other people, and never seemed to learn how either.

For those few people, who might miss me now that I'm gone, I also want to extend my apologies. I know it doesn't mean much, but it's the only thing I can say at this point. You brought a lot of good into my life, and kept me here longer than I ever expected.

## Why I Was Unhappy
