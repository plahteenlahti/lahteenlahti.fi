There's thing that often comes up in my conversations with people. Someone asks: "hey what are doing this weekend?" And I would want to freeze there and then. Because for me the answer is almost always the same:

"I think I'm going to work a little."

Followed by a random explanation or addition. "Because I'm really busy right now", "We have big release coming", or my favorite one yet "but I'm only going to work a little, I'm going to do this and this".
