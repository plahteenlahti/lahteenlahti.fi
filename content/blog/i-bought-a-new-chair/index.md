Today I'm getting a new lounge chair, which I ordered eight weeks ago. It's not just any chair. It's the first chair I've ever bought. It also a very costly chair:

8 700 euros.

It is the Eames Lounge Chair. With the Ottoman, of course. Without the Ottoman, it's like riding a bicycle without the saddle: the first thing people will ask is why don't have it, and it is also rather unpleasant experience. If you've never Eames Lounge Chair before, here is a picture of it:

You might have also seen this chair in movies such as the Iron Man and Tron Legacy or TV shows such as Frasier and Gossip Girl. Perhaps you've even sat in one when visiting one of the hotels in the Clarion hotels chain. Designed by a quirky designer couple, Charles and Ray Eames, this chair is, in my opinion, the epitome of lasting functional design (also the embodiment of American design). Design that survives through the years

## The Eames Lounge Chair

The Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman (officially 670 and 671 respectively) were first introduced in 1956. There are many stories of how Charles wanted the feeling of sitting in the chair resemble that of sitting in an "old well-worn baseball mitt." While I can't describe the feeling of sitting in this chair, such mainly because I've sat in a baseball mitt, I can vouch for the chair's comfiness. At least with my dimensions.

You see, as the Eames Lounge Chair was originally designed in the 1950s, back when people were a smidge shorter. While I can easily reach the upper cupboard shelves, I'm what women in Tinder like to call "not tall enough to ride this ride" (meaning I'm under 185cm, 177cm to be exactish). For me, this chair is the perfect fit. If you're taller than this, don't you worry, as Eames Lounge Chair is manufactured in two sizes these days: "the classic" and the "not so classic for less vertically spread."

"...carry you over to that Eames classic and show you why it's the best-engineered chair in the world!" â€“ Frasier Crane.

Talking about manufacturing, this chair is manufactured by two companies. Herman Miller manufacturers all the chairs sold in the United States and Vitra manufactures all the chairs in Europe (I'm not sure how the manufacturing for the other continents is handled, but I'm guessing they just have to do with replica chairs).

The manufacturing of the chairs has stayed much the same throughout the years (at least for Herman Miller, Vitra licensed the chair later own, and most likely has a slightly different manufacturing process). What has changed are the materials, most of which have replaced greener and more mass producible alternatives (no more Brazilian rosewood or feathers ). As the Eameses constantly experimented with new materials, this seems only fitting.

Overall the Eames Lounge Chair, as viewed from the manufacturing side, is something that I feel is well balanced between being just enough mass-produced to benefit from it. But with enough manual work and artisanal take to elevate the build quality. The end product is a timeless product, that can last through ages (used Eames Lounge Chair are as much as expensive as new ones)

## But Why Did You Buy It?

The Eames Lounge Chair without question, a very expensive chair. Many would consider buying it to be a sign of careless spending, and maybe it is. I would argue otherwise (of course I would, I'm the one who bough it). However this

Going back to what I said about timeless, functional design. I think Eames Lounge Chair is timeless product not because of the materials and

Time will, of course, tell whether buying this chair was actually a wise thing to do. One thing is for certain; if I had just bought an Ikea chair, this article would also not exist. I'm not sure who is the bigger fool, the person who wrote about the lounge chair be bought, or the person who read said person's text about that lounge chair?
