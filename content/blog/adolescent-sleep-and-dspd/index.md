1. Introduction

The transition from adolescence to adulthood is also often accompanied by an alteration in sleep-wake behavior (Wolfson & Carskadon, 1998). Surveys around the world report an alteration in the sleep-wake cycle, adolescent sleep shifting towards both a later bedtime as well as later wake-up time [Check (Kuula et al., 2019). This leads to classing of circadian preference and environmental factors such as school (Crowley et al., 2014). Even as the amount of sleep adolescents require decreases from childhood, many adolescents globally do not get the 8-10 hours of sleep that they require (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015; American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016). The effects of this shift are evident in behavior change, for example as increased risk-taking (O'Brien & Mindell, 2005) and in academic performance. Adolescent sleep deprivation also exhibits the same effects of decreased cognitive performance as adults [43] and the same detrimental effect on health [].

For most adolescents, the alteration in sleep-wake behavior often balances out as they develop further into adulthood. In extreme cases, the shift in sleep-wake behavior leads to chronic inability to fall asleep and wake up at the desired time, the delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD). Individuals with DSPD exhibit a consistently delayed sleep time when compared to healthy individuals and are consistently out of sync with environmental circadian oscillators. (Crowley, Acebo, & Carskadon, 2007). As a result individuals with DSPD are locked into a sleep-wake cycle that conflicts with the usual work and school requirements, which poses higher risk on health as well [28]

The focus of this thesis are the ways of measuring the circadian phase length in adolescents and how the measured lengths correlate with a selected variable. The first chapter of the thesis introduces and reviews existing research on circadian phase length, especially in adolescence. Previous methods of measuring the circadian phase length are also reviewed and compared with each other. The second chapter of the thesis describes the methodology used in the study to measure the length of the circadian phase in study participants. The results of the study are presented in the third chapter of the thesis. The final chapter of the thesis summarizes the key findings of the study.
1.1 The circadian clock, circadian period and chronotype

Sleep is regulated by two underlying processes: (1) the homeostatic process mediates the preference towards sleep when awake and the dissipation of the same preference during sleep, through the secretion of neurotransmitter adenosine; (2) the circadian process, regulates the sleep-wake cycle and oscillating at a near 24-hour cycle (Czeisler et al., 1999 [44]), Human behavior, as well as human biology, runs on this internally synchronized clock. This rhythm, as developed through the natural selection, has favored an endogenous system that when devoid of periodic synchronizing cues persists intrinsically towards a period length that is close to that of 24 hours.

The circadian oscillation synchronizes (entrains) itself with environmental oscillation of solar time through external cues; zeitgebers; such as the light of the sun. Other external cues not directly connected to the solar time, such eating, exercising and social interactions can also entrain individual’s circadian rhythm. Due to this our lifestyle choices can pose great risk for the correct timing of our circadian clock as it can misalign the natural circadian rhythm from. This biological preference for timing is is called chronotype. Chronotype stays much the same during our lifetime.

The circadian clock, as well as circadian period length and chronotype vary among individuals with some individuals manifesting a circadian period shorter than 24 hours and some longer than 24 hours [28, 51], Sex and ancestral differences have been shown to increase variaety in circadian period length [52]. Usually our circadian rhythm is programmed to enable high activity during the day and sleep during the night [53]. However, life-style choices are common disruptors of this rhythm, and can lead to a mismatch between the environmental timing and internal circadian rhythm, also known as the external desynchronization. Occurrence of this mismatch leads to individuals adjusting their circadian rhythm to a new sleep-wake cycle, which is considered to be detrimental to health and wellbeing [55]. Therefore maintaining the correct alignment in between our sleep schedule and circadian rhythm can be viewed to be essential for our health, wellbeing and safety.

1.2 Studies on intrinsic circadian period length [27]
Various studies on circadian phase length have yielded inconsistent results (Czeisler et al., 1999). The earliest studies of the circadian phase length, those conducted by Aschoff, established the baseline for circadian phase length to be over 25 hours (Aschoff, 1965). More recent studies have since displayed results ranging from 13 to 65 hours [12 from 30].

What makes the evaluation of the circadian process especially difficult is that the system itself can not be observed directly (Wever, 2013). Additionally, many of the techniques for measuring circadian phase length are unsuitable for assessing the circadian phase length in adolescents []. While one can measure circadian period length on rodents through long-term isolation from all light sources, such a method is not suitable for humans. For adults, prolonged isolation both temporally and socially is also is one way to measure it, but such a technique would be considered unethical and harmful to adolescents.

Most often the physical measurements of circadian period length are done either by 1) measuring the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), 2) measuring the temperature of the individual either oral temperature readings, rectal temperature readings, or axillary temperature, or through skin temperature readings [54]. Of these methods, the skin temperature reading is the least invasive one and also the one allowing almost constant reading through multiple days. Skin temperature measurements can be taken using wearable temperature sensors such as the iButton, an inexpensive, wireless data logger that can be used to obtain a valid measurement of human skin temperature [56].

1.3 Changes in sleep in adolescence
During adolescence young people often go through a phase shift, in which the circadian cycle adjusts towards a later timing of sleep/wake behavior [20,22,23,24,34,40]. This change can be noticed from survey studies around the world, in which display an evident emergence of two separate patterns (Carskadon, Labyak, Acebo, & Seifer, 1999). First, the bedtimes on both school and non-school nights shifts towards later time, of approximately [todo, aika]. Second, due to the school night's wakeup times not adjusting to this later bedtime, wake-up times on non-school nights as well as vacation nights shifts to a later time to make up for the lost sleep. Papers focusing on cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using actigraphically measured sleep also support the findings of survey studies [].

In addition to shifting to a later bed and rising times, a delay in adolescent’s circadian phase preference, also known as chronotype has been identified. Chronotype questionnaires categorize subjects to predetermined categories, based on their propensity to sleep at a particular time.

1.4 Delayed sleep phase disorder
Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder in which a person’s sleep episode is chronically delayed; a person often falls asleep for example between 01:00 and 03:00 [47]. Simultaneously falling asleep at more conventional times, such as 22:00 to 0:00, often fails. Consequently, DSPD often leads to the individual not receiving enough sleep. Symptoms of delayed sleep phase typically surface for the first time in adolescense with prevalence estimates residing between 7-16% percent in total population (gradisar 2011) . A significant number of insomnia sufferers area affected by DSPD [46]. DSPD is also more commonly seen in adolescents [47] as

Delayed sleep phase disorder can also have predominant influence, caused by adolescent’s own choice to remain awake past their optimal bedtime [47].

According to [s] studies, DSPD as a phenomenon is linked to the maximal state of circadian alertness, meaning individuals suffering from DSPD have problems falling asleep at earlier bedtimes as their body’s circadian rhythm is in the wake-maintenance zone (WMZ) signaled by core body temperature being in its maximal state. For normal sleepers, WMZ takes place between clocktimes of 18:00 to 22:00. Consequently for DSPD individuals the WMZ is delayed by the same amount as their circadian rhythm.

1.5 Research questions

Given the previously reflected material on the length of the circadian cycle and delayed sleep phase disorder especially in adolescence, it is evident that more studies need to be done in order to understand the connection and interplay between the two. This study focuses on

Based on previous research the following research questions and hypotheses were made:

Research question 1:
Is circadian phase length associated with an individual's propensity towards delayed sleep phase disorder?

Hypothesis 1:
Circadian phase length is associated with delayed sleep phase disorder symptoms in the selected sample.
