#### Dear manager, this goes to both you and me.

You know why people quit? Because they hate their job? Because they get paid more somewhere else? Because they feel that they can achieve more somewhere else?

Nah fam.

People quit because they don’t want identify the themselves with that job anymore. They find themselves thinking **_“if I die today, is this the thing I want to remembered for?_**” and in 99% of the cases the answer is:

**_“Fuck nah”_**

I know this because I’ve been trying to make it work at one unnamed bank for almost three years. You might wonder why I have not just changed jobs, and to be honest, I’ve been wondering that myself too. Almost daily.

The fact is, that quitting feels like losing. It feels that there’s more wrong in me, than in the company. Even though I know it is not about me. I worked some really shitty jobs, and still felt motivated to get up in the morning. Even when I was working 12 hour days in carpentry and delivering morning newspapers, I still found a reason to get up in the morning.

I’m not ready to lose. If nothing else, I want to be remembered for my formidable grit.

### Remedy

So how do you stop your employees from thinking about killing themselves because of their job?

I’ve been working in a bank for almost three years now, and always wondered how it seems to be almost impossible to make the working environment good. It feels that only two types of people work at a bank, those that hate their life and those and that don’t have one.

No, but seriously. This should not need to be said in the 21st century. But the easiest way to become observant about how your employees are doing, both in their work and in their personal life (best teams are close and personal) is to go beyond the hierarchy and processes.

1. Managers should think of themselves as part of the team. This means actually spending time with your team mates. It’s called building rapport. 20 euros to buy your team a pack of beer every Friday, which you consume together while talking about the past week, is a way to start.
2. Employees should grow some fucking balls. No manager is going to fix your problems if you don’t talk about them. It if feels hard, start by reflecting on them by yourself. Just like I’m trying to do here.

So that is what I have to say to you my dear manager. I’m willing to talk about these things with you, and also willing to admit that I’m potentially wrong, and just the wrong type of a person for this job. Then I’ll just quit, but let’s first have chat about that.

Ps. If there is someone reading this that wants to vent about how shitty they feel about their job, I would be glad to receive that venting. Then we can complain together and trade tips about quick and easy suicide methods.
