Not really a fan of yearly reviews. I think there's easier ways to brag about your accomplishments than trying to mask them under a yearly review. However, if you should ever review a year, this one would be it. So here's 20 things about 2020 from my perspective.

1. **COVID**  
   This first point probably suprises on one. For most this year has brough massive changes to their lives. For me though, it didn't really change anything. Maybe it's because Finland handled the whole situation relatively well. Or perhaps is just that live in general is a lot easier for a priviledged white males, and even things like global pandemic can't change that. It tells a little bit about the size of my social circles when I say that nobody that I truly know caught corona virus this year. Maybe I've just been incredibly lucky (knocks on wood)?

2. **Nyxo**  
   This was a hard year for Nyxo. Last year end on a positive note, with taking part in TechCrunch Disrupt, getting a small business loan approved and then the COVID happened. We lost some clients: all the work we were doing with airlines evaporated instantly, some clients stopped answering email completely, and some asked to talk again in the autumn. We applied for Business Finland COVID funding but got almost nothing (later I found out that companies doing half the revenue we had, had received over 10 times as much funding). My co-founder had just flown to San Fransisco to explore that option but was forced to fly back after just two weeks. Eventually we also had to lay off the people we had hired in the beginning of the year.

   Remains to be seen what happens next. We've managed to get some of the momentum back, but we are still far away from what we had year ago. I'm going to write a separate post about Nyxo at a later time, and I certainly hope it's not an obituary, but you never know with these bootstrapped startups (you either succeed of you die). If you one help, trying out the app, giving feedback and leaving an app store review is something I would really appreciate.

3. **Your boy's got bachelor's now**  
   Yeah, so I finally have something to show for my studies after this year, after managing to submit all the required papers for completing Bachelor's of science in cognitive science. I know this is going to surprise some people, because most have probably though that I have degree in something already. Thing is, I started studying cognitive science in 2013, and managed to complete almost both master's and bachelor's degrees in two years, but I didn't. I was so caught up in other things such as building companies, that I didn't even have time to submit my bachelor's thesis to be reviewed despite it being finished. This year I realized that my parents might never witness me graduate so I decided to put some of time in finishing my studies (I've personally don't see them as being that valuable anymore, I might write about th). I still need to finish up on master's thesis, but I hope to get that done in the spring now.

4. **Spending more time with my parents**  
   This year I've focused more time on spending time with my parents, which is weird because few years ago my only reason for visiting them was to checkup on the apartments I own in city they live. Not because we were on bad terms or anything, I was just in a bad place and felt going there as burden. But this year I've spent more time with them. They're getting older, and eventually it will be too late to spend that time with them.

5. **Loneliest year?**  
   Not sure if it's because of the

6. **Six years of 60 hours a week**  
   Since 2014 when I stopped studying full-time I've worked an average of 60 hours a week. Sometimes this has meant studying and working full-time at the same time, sometimes it has been working two jobs at same time (once even three jobs for a short period of time), but mostly it's been because I've worked a day job while buildin a company. This is year is no different, however I'm starting to see that this will no longer work (the cognitive strain seems to be too much). Next year I might dial down on the workload a little and spend more time being bored.

7. **Great year for falsely thinking you're great at investing**  
   This year has been tremendously great for my savings and investments. So great actually, that I've started to consider selling all my stocks and even some of the apartments (I bought two more this year, bringing the total number on managed apartments to four). At the same time even noticed how people in general seem to be more interested in investing, which is a good thing but also makes me a bit skeptical if we're approaching the top of the roller coaster and things will soon start looking a lot scarier.

8. **Reading and writing more**  
   Earlier this year my goal was to speak at more software development conferences (did my first ones in 2019 and liked experience a lot) but COVID kind of ruined that so I decided to write some software articles. That has been a mild success so I might do more of it in the future.

   I also read more this year (about 100 books, 30 more than last year), and plan on spending more time in the future reading. Beginning of this year I had bit of slump with reading and had only read 4 books in June, before I again found the interest to continue reading. Let's see if I have something similar next year, or if I'm finally able to get to my goal of reading 10 books a month ðŸ˜„

9. **Cyberpunk 2077 (and gaming in general)**  
   I haven't been gaming in a long time, but this year I decided to change that and bought the new Xbox Series X, and boy, did it change my evenings. I've been having almost as much fun playing as I 15 years ago. Cyberpunk 2077 is also great; I don't care what others say. I'm going to post some of my thoughts about the game soon.

10. **VC fatigue**  
     Not sure what the reason behind this, but I'm getting tired of VCs.

11. **DND and other novel experiences**

12. **Living those teenage dreams**  
    When I was a teenager and had just gotten my driver's license I used to envy other people who were driving new cars (or even had their own cars). The only car I had access to was my father's truck.

13. **Pretty fucking good at React Native**
    I've coded a lot this year. I've built new apps, large component libraries, refactored some of my old projects and build some truly novel stuff as well (for example a cross-platform renderer for mobile and web using React Native, as well as few App Clips byt cramming React Native inside that tiny space). I applied for few jobs out of curiosity and turns out and pretty fucking good at what I do. This is a big thing, because three years ago I still considered myself mainly a designer who does code, but now it's the otherway around.

14. **Eames lounge chair**  
    This is going to sound shallow and materialistic, but one of the highlights of this year for me was buing an Eames lounge chair. It the most beautiful thing I've eved owned, and I've found myself spending more time at home just to sit in it. I've desired this chair for 5 years now, and finally decided to get it after all this time.

15. **Losing all interest in moving to USA**  
    A year ago if someone had asked were I want to be in 2 years, I would have said "living and working in USA". But this has definitely changed my mind on this matter. Reading about the all the stuff happening there, bad handling of COVID, racism, white supremacy, the healthcare clusterfuck, republicans (even from an outsider's perspective Mich McConnel seems like pawn of satan) has chipped away all my interest. I don't think Biden's election will change this in the short term either, so it could be that one of my biggest dreams just died this year.

16. **Helping others**  
     I've tried to spend more time helping others this year. I should probably do more in this area, but offering help doesn't come easily to someone who is afraid myself to ask for help. So I'm saying now, if you need help with anything, no matter if it's work related or not I want to help. Just ask, I will most likely say yes.

17. **Lottery**  
    This year I noticed a very weird behavior which isn't like me at all.

20. **Not the worst year, not the best year**  
    Looking at everything going around the world, I must say I'm in an incredibly priviledged position.
