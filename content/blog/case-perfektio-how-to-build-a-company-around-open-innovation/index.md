#### How one company gets majority of its clients through open innovation challenges

_Can you imagine a successful IT company without a single sales person, that spends less than 500 euros yearly on advertising, yet works with some of the biggest industry leaders in the world? I can, as I have witnessed that type of an approach work despite all the odds for year and half now at Perfektio. Our secret sauce is_ [**_open innovation challenges_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_innovation) _and here’s how it works._

### Hackers make the best problem solvers

Before diving into how we did this, I’m going to describe the situation from which we started. When we founded Perfektio a bit over year ago, we had no experience in running a software company, no connections, no sales experience, and no proof that we are good at what we do. To put it in a nutshell, we were a software company that did not have clients nor means to get them.

Our group of founders had met at a hackathon, one type of an open innovation challenge, back in 2015 and had continued to run into each other after that in similar open innovation events. In these events we had slowly been building experience that would end up being our competitive edge.

During all those innovation challenges we had transformed into competent problems solvers, and learned how to turn novel ideas into something concrete. This was surprise even to us. No one could have guessed coding for fun, drinking too many energy drinks, and sleeping too little during those countless weekends could lead to anything good.

> Realizing this lead us to rethink our value proposition. We were not going to be a software company, but a company which specializes in solving problems through open innovation. This lead us to form a hypothesis: “innovation challenges are a viable method of selling software projects”. Next step was to to put this idea to test.

Our first Industryhack event Hack The Living with YIT, January 2017

Our first open innovation challenge as a company was Industryhack’s [Hack the Living with YIT](https://industryhack.com/challenges/hacktheliving/). Unfortunately we did not win this challenge, but it provided valuable learning in how to transform the innovative concepts into solid pilot project proposals. We continued participating in different innovation challenges and slowly build our framework for turning the ideas created in those into concrete projects.

### Selling innovation and problem solving is a tough cookie to crack.

Now after one year, 8 Industryhack challenges, 20 other open innovation challenges, 6 pilot projects and a couple of not as fruitful efforts of turning concepts into pilot projects, we have validation for our hypothesis. **Competing in innovation challenges does indeed work as a means of finding projects and clients**. Creating the framework for doing this at scale however, turned out to be more difficult that previously expected, but we’re getting there.

Even though we have successfully won countless quite many challenges, and turned most of them into successful pilot projects as well, our framework for doing this could be described to _minimum viable_ at best. It will still take a little bit work before our approach leads to massive growth. Things that still need work are scoping the pilots well and being better at understanding how to boost the clients on capabilities to act in an agile way.

We have made a lot of progress in this short time but still have some work to do. Of course we have not achieved this alone and will not achieve it alone in the future either. Therefore, I would like to conclude our story by thanking Industryhack for everything they’ve created, for the connection to the industries as well as the talented community around open innovation. Without Industryhack we certainly wouldn’t be where we are now.
