As previously mentioned, we are building a Hacker Community here at Perfektio. [The previous post hopefully gave you an idea about the vision](https://medium.com/perfektio/announcing-perfektio-community-5fd43baa278e) we have for this community, at least on an abstract level. This article, however, goes straight into the nitty gritty details of being a part of this community, and into concrete examples of what you get out this!

Letâ€™s get started.

#### **Hackathon hunting and applyingÂ services**

We have applied to hundreds of hackathons over the years, and through trial and error learned what are the magic words to get you accepted. We are also sometimes invited to pretty exclusive hackathons that might not always reach you, although you might be the perfect hacker for those hackathons. Therefore, we will be providing you help in finding good hackathons and team members and writing that killer application. In practice, first we first invite you to our Slack, where we are periodically posting new hackathons. You click thumbs up on the ones you like, and from there on we will take care of most of the heavy work, such as finding team members for you, brainstorming a good idea together with your team, and of course applying for the hackathon.

In the future we are aiming to provide even more help to get you into hackathons. For example, we are currently building our own hackathon portal, and developing means to provide travel reimbursements for hackathons outside of your hometown.

#### **Hackathon coaching**

How to work effectively in a hackathon? What framework should I use for my web app? What kind of ideas win hackathons? We will aim to answer these questions together with you. We have succeeded and failed at building things in hackathons and at this point we have a pretty good idea of what you can achieve in hackathons and how to be effective in them. Our community members will get the best tips and tricks for building solutions in hackathons. We will also periodically provide coaching on subjects such as pitching, project management and service design in hackathon context.

#### **Acceleration after hackathons**

We believe that hackathons and other innovation competitions can be a starting point for building new products and services, as well founding new companies. But it is also hard, and most things built in a hackathon never go anywhere, even the promising ones. That is what we want to change. In order to grow hackathon projects into something big, we are preparing to provide mentoring and other relevant resources for our community members to advance their hackathon projects.

#### **Meetups**

A community is not really a community without personal interaction. Since people are the critical ingredient that make a community, we warmly welcome you to join all of our events! We plan to organize meetups every two months or so, with a different topic each time. In addition to short talks in relevant topics, we will look to the future, plan for future hackathons and remind people of upcoming events. Meetups are also a great place to do some team building with some complementary food and drinks!

#### **Ever changing pool ofÂ perks**

Look, we know that some of the following perks might not be that valuable for everybody. Or maybe there is something missing from our community. We might not be getting this right on the first try, but we hope that you can help us with that. We are open to any ideas that would increase your interest and make this community more valuable for you. We donâ€™t want to be a great community, we simply want to be the best.
