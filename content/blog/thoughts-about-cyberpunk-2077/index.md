Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game. I know that many people would seek to challenge me on this declaration. For those who don't know what Cyberpunk is, I'll give you quick rundown:

Based on board game from 1970, Cyberpunk is an role-playing game (later titled action game by the developer) developed by the same Polish software company behind series of Witcher games, most notable of them being the third game. First announced in 2013, people have been waiting for Cyberpunk 2077 for some time now. And the wait has certainly not been easy. The release of the game has been delayed a few times, with the latest delay causing some fanatic fans of the game to send death threats to the developers.

Cyberpunk's launch has in many ways been a unique and not before seen event. Rarely has a game had such a hyped up launch and all such a public crash and burn. Well, launch No Man's Sky hype -> crash and burn lifecycle when it was released, albeit at a much smaller level. No Man's Sky did not also gather that much media hype
