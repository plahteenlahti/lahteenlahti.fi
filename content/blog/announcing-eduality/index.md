Our aim is to bring forth a new era of learning and teaching. We are going to revolutionize the way students learn by offering two key improvements: interesting and engaging learning materials as well as detailed learning analytics and tools for teachers.

First, immersive learning experiences make learning fun for the students, but they also have many pedagogical advantages. Hearing native English speakers converse in an authentic environment increases the transfer effect. Virtual reality also allows students to experience places and phenomena otherwise inaccessible: imagine seeing the ancient Colosseum in it’s full glory, visiting a rainforest and seeing the flora and fauna in full detail, or getting up close to the structure of molecules.

Second, our learning platform allows teachers to gain invaluable insights about their students’ work in the virtual reality environment. Observing, in real time, where students direct their attention helps the teacher know what motivates and interests them.

The Eduality team consists of already established professionals that have achieved great results by working together. We have knowledge, skills and professional experience in all the necessary fields: software development, psychology, pedagogy and design.

We are rolling out the first demo of our platform shortly and we are extremely excited about developing our revolutionary learning platform further!
