so hi my name is Perttu LÃ¤hteenlahti and I'm
going to talk to you about open
innovation and especially about the
experiences we've had it with that in
Finland it's a little bit of more about
the topics I'm first going to dive into
what is open innovation and what is this
already mentioned hackathons and how do
they relate I'm also going to talk about
why you should care about it and after
that I'm going to go in the details and
talk what we have learned as the company
that I represent and also the industry
that we have worked together with what
they have learned from open innovation
but before we dive into that I just want
to say a couple of words so hi I'm Beth

- I'm a designer and a software
  developer by trade I've been doing that
  for some years now building different
  products different digital services for
  companies in different industries but my
  background is actually in cognitive
  science so I've been studying how the
  brain works and for some odd reason that
  led in the software development which
  I'm not sure how that enough but also
  I'm a hackathon fanatic what that means
  in in my word hackathon is the same as
  an open innovation challenge and in last
  two years I've taken part in around 53
  weeks ago I was in the Vatican hacking
  for Pope which was actually quite a
  weird experience but really nice
  experience but besides all this I'm also
  a co-founder of a company called
  perfectio and we craft diamond standard
  digital experiences that's why we have a
  diamond in our logo what we do is much
  the same as any other software
  consultancy so we are a full-stack house
  we provide everything from the business
  side to the design the development side
  but the thing is what separates us from
  the other companies that we don't
  actually have a single service person in
  our company we have never done cold
  calling we get all our clients through
  open innovation challenges such as
  hackathons and it works really well in
  our case and actually our reason is to
  be the number one partner for many
  companies in building
  halation digitalization projects as well
  as new pictures new business protests
  through open innovation but I'll get to
  the back to the topic at hand what is
  open innovation how many of have you
  heard this word before
  can I get our hands up if you heard this
  little okay how many of you have heard
  the word hackathon okay that's that's
  better cuz use its it seems to be the
  other way around because people have
  some kind of wake idea what innovation
  means but if we take the textbook
  example it means using outside resources
  meaning outside resources outside it for
  company to actually foster innovation
  and one way of doing this is through
  open innovation challenges for example
  hackathons and now you're wondering what
  are what are these hackathons so usually
  there are 12 to 14 for 48 hours
  innovation competitions where you have a
  bunch of people coming together to solve
  your problems or not necessary or
  problems but some let's say well-defined
  problems so for example I was in Vatican
  hacking for social good so we were
  coming up with solutions how to make it
  easier to include people in different
  social circles and how we do this in
  hackathons is that 48 hours is not a lot
  of time so we have to spend that all
  that time really well and usually that
  means that you build some kind of a
  concept or prototype solution let's say
  a first Minimum Viable Product version
  of your product that could solve that
  problem usually they look like this
  because they originate from let's say
  student hackathon so college hackathons
  you have a lot of students they come
  there with their computers most of them
  from computer science background and for
  a weekend
  they just code up something they build
  something that they think is cool they
  represent that on the last day and if
  they do get they might give a price for
  that but nothing comes out of that
  except that in in many cases you might
  have heard the phrase that if you have
  enough
  monkeys you can write a Shakespeare play
  the thing is with if you have enough
  students you might get at some point
  uber or something similar so it's it's
  like you throw a lot of seeds but
  nothing grows out of it and there's a
  reason for that
  and we're actually doing things a little
  bit differently so this is what our
  hackers used to look like in this one
  we're actually working with three-member
  team at why I tease premises it's a big
  company in Finland the manufactures
  houses I think it does that in Russia as
  well besides three of us there was
  actually six no-call five other teams
  solving yit is problems in getting
  unsold apartments sold and besides the
  team's there working we also had people
  from the company from yit working with
  us so we had one person we send it up
  being the vice president of sales
  mentoring us for all 24 eight hours we
  could just ask her questions constantly
  okay how does your business do this how
  do you do this what if we do something
  like this and at the end of the day
  after 48 hours we had some kind of a
  prototype product that we could show her
  and then in the end show the whole
  company in a public pitching session
  that this is something we think Wyatt
  yit could do and tell therefore reduce
  the amount of unsold houses but in our
  case it really stops at the hackathon so
  there's first part is always the
  hackathon you go there you hack together
  something you make a prototype and
  that's what the second dose do as well
  and many other hackathons but we have to
  actually continue after that so once
  we're done with the hack once it looks
  good we're confident that this is
  something we could build we actually
  make a pilot protest proposal and we
  sent that out to the company we say that
  okay for twenty thousand euros we could
  build something like this in two months
  we could test it with real customers and
  let's just see where it goes there we
  don't have to make any longer agreements
  they don't have to buy anything else
  besides that from us let's just test
  does the product work actually
  and after we were done with the pilot
  project if it all goes well we of course
  continue working on it we've had
  multiple cases where that has happened
  so we built something
  and the company has been it okay this
  this worked really well
  we loved working with you let's work
  together in the future as well sometimes
  means it means working on the same
  project sometimes it means you're again
  a different project but why you should
  care about this two things so when
  you're organizing an open innovation
  challenge you get a lot of new ideas
  ideas that your own employees or your
  organization members might have not come
  up with or might not be able to work on
  because they have to work on different
  subjects that are more important at the
  moment and to you get innovation
  partners usually in an Innovation
  Challenge open innovation challenge
  let's say you have 10 teams you get to
  create ideas those are the ideas which
  you can continue with those are the
  ideas that could someday become products
  of your company or service your
  companies providing you have three ideas
  which are ok they might need further
  development or they might need further
  research they realize they'll get this
  just doesn't work and most of the ideas
  are really bad just just the truth of it
  so you get from 10 10 teams you have
  they're working on your problems you get
  5 solutions that don't go anywhere and
  you're actually bit embarrassed to even
  listen about them but that's just the
  play of the game that that happens and
  you shouldn't feel that is somehow
  invaluable to you actually it's really
  valuable to also hear the bad ideas
  because all the points when your company
  your company is not for example building
  the greatest ideas at the moment they
  could be doing that but they don't have
  to spend time building stupid ideas
  either because someone has already done
  that work someone has made that into a
  prototype that you can test out but I
  think the number one number two reason
  is the more important so you get an
  innovation partners because ideas aren't
  actually worth anything most of us get
  10 good ideas a day but there may never
  lead into anything
  and through open innovation challenges
  you have a chance to actually find a
  team that could implement that idea for
  example in our cases in hackathons in
  open innovation challenges
  we rarely build anything that we don't
  feel passionate about so everything that
  we propose the company something that we
  would love to build with we would
  passionately work on it sometimes even
  crunching hours over the let's say the
  limit how much we have built them and
  this is your best chance of finding them
  because you get to for for 48 hours in
  the open innovation challenge you
  actually get to work with the companies
  that could solve your problems in that
  sense so let's say in our case we're
  working with yit they get a pretty good
  view of how we like to do things how we
  like to work how we like to design
  things how we'd like to develop software
  what is the communication between us and
  the company and everything like that
  it's just virtually really well and you
  get to know the company it doesn't go
  like in the traditional way when you
  have a let's say IT project you send out
  ten you send out let's say the question
  to ask for proposals and then you get
  ten proposals back that okay this
  company could do it for hundred thousand
  three hundred thousand euros and so on
  but you never really get done any idea
  how how is that gonna play out you just
  pick one from random you throw a dice or
  whatever you come up with good one and
  it sometimes works in most cases worse
  but sometimes doesn't so open innovation
  challenges allows you to step over that
  stone I don't have to get stopped at
  that point but then what have we learned
  from this and what have the companies
  with work together so during last year
  we did 25 open innovation challenges
  which 10 of them led to continue
  discussions and five of them are
  currently in pilot project mode at the
  moment of those pilot
  that we have currently now one is high
  up one is la sortie kanuha
  one is all the University one is only
  Ninh who is a manufacturer's tools or
  sales tools and one is no that don't
  remember it Fisk ours is one but that is
  in country whatever so what we have
  learned when talking with them and
  continuing the pilot with them is that
  they are interesting projects people
  love working on this project our side
  and their side as well so we just
  concluded a pilot with la serda kana who
  provides cleaning services it's a big
  publicly listed company and we built
  this new kind of service with them and
  our developers and designers loved
  working on that project that is not
  uncommon in software development world
  but there are a lot of project where you
  don't love working on it and so far of
  all the projects that we've gotten
  through open innovation all the
  developers and designers have loved
  those projects so they always feeling
  passionate about them but the same goes
  for the clients as well so let's not
  they can I gave gave us the highest
  praises that we have ever gotten from a
  single company and they just worked for
  two months with us in a project that was
  good had for do was doing from the start
  because it was so outrageous by the idea
  and no one was expecting anything to
  come out of this so there's a lot of bad
  things already waiting but still they
  loved working on it but the second thing
  that we've learned that it's also hard
  it's actually really hard to take these
  open innovation challenges turn them
  into pilot project with the companies
  and then they inter further development
  as I said we had 20 open innovation
  challenges last year and only five of
  those are currently in pilot phase and
  the main thing is that usually when you
  have an open innovation challenge it's
  your company organizes it or you talk to
  some organizer who decides to put up
  really big hackathon with hundreds of
  people taking part
  but the thing is if it's if it's badly
  organised hackathon if it's badly
  organized open innovation channels it
  never leads to anywhere and in Finland
  we have a lot of companies already doing
  this Stella Raye I've been traveling
  around Europe seeing how the competition
  ways out in there and they're really bad
  at this no one is doing this currently
  you know well just to put out names
  there is a company called industry hack
  I'd say they are the top crate they're
  organised open innovation challenges for
  companies they've been doing that with I
  don't know over 30 publicly listed
  companies they have assembly exemplary
  results another one is ultra hack that's
  the similar thing more on they have like
  single event with five different
  companies at the same time so it's a bit
  of different but yeah it's hard but it
  shouldn't be it doesn't have to have to
  be but you also have to commit there's
  number three points we have to commit we
  just can't go to hackathons build
  something that we like to do and hope
  that someone just gives us money but we
  actually have to commit to the problems
  that the company is having in high up
  escapes we were building we were solving
  their crane safety problems so they they
  manufacture cranes that you put on on
  trucks to load big big objects into the
  truck and that is pretty hazardous thing
  to do and we went there they showed us
  how the cranes work what are the things
  that make it so hazardous and through
  that we actually learn to understand
  that okay these their problem this what
  defines the problem how we could solve
  this and we came up with an idea that
  wait we could use drones to monitor
  around the crane when you're handling
  handing something heavy object heavy
  objects so that the load the crane
  handler doesn't get crushed by the
  object if it falls by accident or
  something like that and we use drones
  for that it's currently going into pilot
  phase we were presented in Nasdaq for it
  because it was somehow such a big deal
  but yeah it requires coming from my from
  our side but it also requires commitment
  from the company is the company's side
  and as well as them whatever who is
  organizing the open innovation challenge
  is to find new solutions for their
  problems
  you just can't organize the challenge
  and say that ok let's take the ideas and
  get away you have to actually take the
  ideas and dedicate a budget to piloting
  them let's say if you have 10 teams try
  to give out at least one or two pilot
  projects from there ok if their ideas
  suck then you have to don't have to do
  that but try to go through ours that
  direction do you have to actually have
  funding to pilot the idea that the teams
  come up with number 4 it works for us so
  as I mentioned earlier we don't have a
  single sales person we started out in
  2016 by selling to two companies that we
  had found from hackathons and we've
  continued doing that we don't have a I
  think we have two clients that are not
  publicly listed companies and we have a
  lot of clients at this point and all of
  that most of them are through open
  innovation challenges some of them are
  of course through because they have
  heard so good things about it
  but most of them are based on the idea
  that we go there we work on their
  project we come up with a solution and
  that con win system that okay these guys
  are good I should hire them for this
  project so it works for us it works
  really well number five it works for you
  as well we have had a lot of positive
  feedback with the companies that we've
  been working with because they they love
  it it allows them to find innovation
  partners that are actually agile in a
  way that current methods don't really
  allow and it also allows them to test
  out ideas that usually would be
  considered too outrageous to do inside
  the company because it would be mean
  that you have to spend five employees
  with time for six months to work on a
  project that you're noticing to know if
  it's gonna ever work out but then you
  can take us who are experienced in doing
  that in short amount of time
  do that in two months see where it goes
  and that's all you have to pay in that
  sense and of course the main thing is
  that that you should take out what we
  have learned is that we are already at
  this point late in the thing so all the
  hackathon organizers that there are
  they're constantly trying to outbid
  others to get different companies but
  isn't really working you have to
  actually provide value so you have to
  provide the pilot project you have to
  provide concrete proof that through open
  innovation you can actually find these
  solutions it works
  some companies haven't just realized
  that it works yet I'm meaning the
  organizers and also the companies that
  take part in like like perfectio in our
  case and and others we have a lot of
  computers at this point we are actually
  taking increasing in speed how we how we
  actually get new projects we get them
  faster we get them we get more projects
  than traditional IT companies at the
  moment so yeah you should start now and
  yeah your rivalry is other companies
  that are operating the same business as
  you are or probably already doing this
  so yeah thank you that's about it
  we hope you have some questions thank
  you thank you very much actually it was
  very very clear message very good
  presentation thank you very much do we
  have questions too about the finished
  experience toupper I think there's a lot
  of anticipation for our discussion next
  about how and whether we should continue
  with a similar format in Estonia but the
  question to you does the public sector
  also use this opportunity yes oh I
  forgot to mention that we were actually
  in Finland we have this now we just
  opened up the public sector for same
  kind of deal it's called
  in a ways and paths in a way so you can
  actually use the same thing for public
  sector as well in Finland and there is a
  pileup
  let's not pileup but there is a open
  innovation challenge about this coming
  out in in May where we have the five
  biggest what are these five biggest
  schools that provide basically basic
  working experience they are putting out
  a challenge to how to solve the dropping
  out of students its vocational schools
  vocational schools yeah vocational
  schools five focus for occasional
  schools are putting out a challenge to
  how to stop students from dropping out
  of their studies and yeah that is
  supposed to go pretty well I'm quite
  confident we are applying it we don't
  know if we're gonna get in there but we
  have some good ideas that how we could
  solve that thing so yeah but it's not
  just public sector alone right they have
  to do with in partnerships with private
  companies in this four month yeah they
  can use this format to find partner
  companies more easily because usually
  the public sector is that it's really
  difficult to do small projects it's
  really difficult to do experimental
  projects but the innovation path that we
  now have opened in Finland that actually
  allows it so you can start it yeah I was
  just gonna say that those are some of
  the companies we have been building
  concepts and and pilot projects for so
  yeah I think some of them are also known
  in Estonia I think hopefully one or two
  or morning any more questions call
  goosey-poosey yes we are doing a
  facebook live so I need you to speak
  into this mic just in case if I if I
  just may add actually it's called
  innovation company in ship and it's EU
  wide project so there is EU funding so I
  don't know probably it somehow already
  works in Estonia as well might be but
  you have to check it it it's a for
  public sector in all over Europe might
  just be
  so any more questions - better finish
  experience comments ideas
  if not then let's give a big applause
  thank you
