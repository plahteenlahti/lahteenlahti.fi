#### Join us in building a community of the most innovative people in the world 💚

### 👋 Hey, Friend!

**Want to be part of something cool?**

Today we are going to announce something we’ve been planning for a long time now. We call it **Hacker Community**, and it’s going to be the number one community for people like you, who like problem solving and building cool things. If you love to take part in hackathons and other innovation challenges, you should definitely be part of this!

This community is for the hackers in all of us.

### 🤔 But why?

Yeah, I know what you’re thinking: “but you’re just a company, what do I care?” That is true, but that is not something we want to be. We want to be something bigger, we want to do things no one else is doing yet. One of those things is being something we call “the anti-startup”.

You know how startups like to focus on things that scale (like mobile apps), while at the same time trying to get rid of things that don’t scale, such as people. We believe this is not enough. In order to foster creative thinking, you have to focus on human factors, and those rarely scale. We want to build things that actually elevate people to be better, and, to achieve that we need to focus on those things that don’t scale. Or, as they like to put it in the Silicon valley:

### 👩‍🚀 What do I get out of this?

Well, for starters, you get a cool picture of yourself, [like the ones you can already find on our site.](https://www.perfektio.fi/en/company)

Okay, but for real, we want to give you something that no other company or community is able to provide. This means transparency about how we solve problems and innovation solutions to companies and the public sector. Concrete examples of this are workshops, hackathons, retreats, meetups, and internal as well as external projects.

Besides teaching you how to hack the planet, we will also take you with us to hackathons around the world. We know how painfully tedious it is sometimes to write those hackathon applications and to come up with the ideas. We will help you with this and also provide all the help you need in making those hackathon projects into real products one day. We are the best in the world at turning hackathon creations into products and new startups. We want you to be the best as well.

**We also want to learn from you.** We think we are doing a lot of things wrong, and what’s better than having a friend helping you out? We want you to help us solve the problems we have in recruitment, accessibility, and inclusion.

If these aren’t enough, we still have a couple of tricks up in our sleeves that we will show you, once we get to know you 😎

### 👍 COOL! Where do I sign up for this?

First, please don’t send your CV or anything like that 😊 We want to really get to know you. So, instead, just send a message to someone at Perfektio, and we will take it from there. Haven’t met any of us yet? Come talk to us in one of the many hackathons we take part in, let’s step aside and have chat about the things you’re passionate about!
