Few days ago I was going through the diary I've been writing during this COVID-19 pandemic, and few things stood out:

1. Many of the entries are rather "rantish"
2. There's not a single great day (I rate every day between 1-10 and there's zero 10 days and most days are below 6)
3. Many of the entries mention watching anime and/or waiting to see what happens in what anime

Points one and two are understandable, but three surprised me. I've never been that big fan of anime despite being a pretty nerdy guy. I have for example seen every Marvel movie on premier day always, one of my favorite things is to read about comic book heroes and villains from Wikipedia
