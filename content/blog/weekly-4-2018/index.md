#### Elon Musk’s productivity tricks, using css to spy on users, making designers great again, and new office!

Weekly is back! This time we got some great articles on design, development, and something completely else. Additionally we have something to tell you on what we’ve been up to in the previous weeks.

### 🤠 What’s up Perfektio?

Lots of things have happened since last weekly. First, we’ve moved into our new office space which is five times bigger than the last one. Here’s a pretty bad picture of it:

You get the idea

Besides that, we also recruited Jussi Maristo a little time ago. Jussi joined us as a developer, and is currently developing React native applications in two of our projects. We’re also looking into hiring more people in the coming weeks, more info about that later.
