Like so many other white boys interested in economics in their youth, I too read Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. I even thought it was great back then. I want to believe I've developed a little more brain mass and can now say that Ayn Rand was a lousy philosopher and even worse human being (it is also fashionable to hate Rand). However, there is one sentence that has stayed with far longer than the other naive philosophies presented in the book:

_"Only one who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth."_

For those who have not read the book, this line comes from the mouth of Francisco d'Anconia, a child prodigy, industrialist, and the heir to the largest copper mining business in the book. Something which many of can definitely relate. Like so many of Rand's characters, the sentence is a statement of what man should work achieve to be over everything else: self-made.

Because only startups which do not need money, are fit to receive it.

## Building a startup in Finland is safe

Before we venture further into this, let's set the context. I've founded three companies so far, all of them in Finland. Never have I considered to be a giant leap into the unknown. Because in Finland, founding a company in Finland is safe. Sure, there's less venture capital available, and VCs, in general, are more cautious about making bad deals mainly because most of them have never walked out on a deal that turned out to be good.

But every other supporting funding vehicle is relatively easy to get. First, the government is willing to back loans of both the entrepreneur and the company, allowing many companies to loan money up to 200k euros, with minimal capital requirements.

On top of the loans, you also have the option of using the "innovation funding" provided by Business Finland, a governmental organization that provides funding for expanding markets and innovation. This too easy relatively easy to get. As long as you're company can be scaled outside of Finland, is not on the verge on bankruptcy (although the most reason Corona funding showed that even this isn't a hard requirement), and your case is handled by a person from their side who understands your business to some degree (things get a lot harder your handler has a background in organic chemistry and you're trying to get to fund a mobile app).

Last but not least, we have pretty good social security, meaning that even if you land on your face after starting a company, you most likely won't die in the gutter. Going slightly of a tangent, I would even argue that Finland doesn't need pre-seed funding because of this. The entrepreneur should be willing to take the first risk, at least if they're a Finn. Pre-seed funding can have a massive positive effect among those not blessed with the holy trinity of privilege: being a white Finnish male. For us, using taking a risk with someone else's money is just another way to shield ourselves from the world that is a lot less forgiving.

## Cockroaches not Poodles

Now because founders and companies have it pretty well here, we've played this game by getting better equipment but not getting better at the game.

Now that shit has hit the fan because of COVID-19, and the money tap is no longer running, many of us have shown how scared we are to seek out another tap from which to quench our thirst.

Shit hits the fan is such a fun way to describe things, so let's continue with this image for a little more. Let the fan represent your startup's current business model, and COVID-19 is the shit. In real life, most of us would most likely throw the fan away and get a new one.

But most startups don't seem to have done that now have they. Instead of running to the fan to get rid of it, many seem to sit on their asses, waiting to smell of shit to die down. What are VCs doing? According to many of them things haven't changed, but I'm finding that hard to believe. Most likely VC funding is going to go to keep the startups afloat and In. Government also come to rescue and started offering additional development funding so companies can try to develop their way out of this situation.

But I'm afraid most companies will use that funding to

What startups should be is more aking to cockroaches. Willing to eat shit.

It is these cockroaches that investors should consider putting their money in. Let the prized poodle die if it can way to survive even with all the opportunities your funding is providing.

I say let startups die. Real world is not like the

We are close to the end,
