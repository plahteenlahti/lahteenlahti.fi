Getting into the tech scene, the world of startups, investors, and technology; is challenging if you didn’t study engineering or business. I know, I was there myself four years ago. Acronyms and weird words get thrown around, and lot and in people seem to live in a completely different world, where, for example, Airbnb is not just a web service, but one of the many companies which’s founders you should know by name.

In the past few years, I have read a lot about startups, investors, technology companies, and their founders. These eight books have, in my opinion, provided the best overview of how the tech scene works. These books talk about how startups function, why some companies can get millions of dollars to develop what is essentially just an idea into reality, and of course, why the tech scene is far from perfect. They are mostly well written, but their value, however, ability to depict the cogs of the tech world.

Although these books can be read in any order, reading them in this order should provide the best experience for beginners and people new to the tech scene.
