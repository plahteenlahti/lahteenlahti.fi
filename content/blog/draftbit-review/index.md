Being both a coder and a designer, design tools that push out working code are close to my heart. Throughout the years I've tested bunch of different tools, from website builders such as Squarespace, Wix and Webflow to tools that spit out mobile code, such as [Supernova](https://supernova.io/) and [Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/). They all leave a little to be desired.

However now there's a new contender in the play [Draftbit](https://draftbit.com/). I've been following Draftbit ever since coming across them as one of the Y combinators w18 batch. I applied to try their app some time ago and finally got an invite to try it. While testing the service I tried to approach from three different sides:

1. As a designer, could I use Draftbit to build prototypes to handover to a developer
2. As a developer, could I replace some of my work with this tool
3. As a entrepreneur, could I build my business on top of this

The end result is what I hope a very throrough and balanced look at a tool.

## What is Draftbit

As mention Draftbit is web based tool that allows you to build native mobile applications. If you've used Figma before,

## How to build stuff with Draftbit

Coming from React Native context, most of the concepts in Draftbit clicked for right away. But those not familiar with React Native, Draftbit uses a component based system allowing you you to build complex UI by combining different low-elevel primitive components such as view blocks and text blocks. In Draftbit these are called **bits**. In addition to bits you have the possibility to use higher level components which can also be a collection bits, called **blocks**. Components such as date picker and slider are examples of a blocks.
