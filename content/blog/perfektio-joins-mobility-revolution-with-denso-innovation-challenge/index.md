#### Teams [Porus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porus_%28mythology%29) and [Tethys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_%28mythology%29) will join Denso in innovating new solutions to the future of mobility

Perfektio will attend the Mobility Revolution innovation challenge (Helsinki, 21.-22.8.2018), hosted by **Denso** and **Industryhack,** with two teams. Through this innovation challenge Denso is looking for solutions, user experience and/or innovations to be used to serve the urban citizens to conveniently get from A to B. More information about the challenge can be [found on Industryhack’s website](https://app.industryhack.com/challenges/mobilityrevolution/).

**Team Porus** will focus on solving the mobility problems of rural areas. Major market potential is seen in building mobility services that allow same kind of ease of use for rural area residents as the services currently being rolled out in major cities. Team consists of **Henri Malkki**, **Jyri Saukkonen**, and will be joined by **Katriina Kallioinen**.

**Team Tethys** in turn will focus on solving the last mile problem in transportation of both humans and goods. Emphasis is placed on building seamless mobility services that allow easy use of multiple mobility and transportation services. Team Tethys consists of **Olli Savisaari**, **Jonne Huotari** and **Jonne Airaksinen**.

Perfektio is more than thrilled to join Denso in building the future of mobility services.
