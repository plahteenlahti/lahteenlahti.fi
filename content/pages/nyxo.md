## TLDR

Nyxo is mobile app that provides sleep coaching and sleep tracking. I built it with React Native, AWS-Amplify, Redux, react-query, styled-components and many other packages and services. The sprititual successor to Nyxo is the work I did on a project called SleepCircle at University of Helsinki when it was still a research commercializtion project.
