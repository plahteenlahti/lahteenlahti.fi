#### Top JS libraries of 2018, 19 web design trends for 2018, and why is Last Jedi so god damn snarky?!

We’re playing around with naming these weeklies to “Best links for hackers”, because there’s relatively little on what we are doing this week or the next sometimes. Also most of the content is links to great things about design and development, that is especially useful for hackathon hackers. Let us know what you think about this :)

### What is Perfektio up to this week?

Two big things happening this week, both during the weekend. First, we’re helping out in the [Kohdataan-hack](http://kohdataan.fi/hackathon/), and providing mentoring in how to build killer products and services in hackathons. In addition, Perttu is traveling to London to take part in [Royal Hackaway.](https://royalhackaway.xyz/)
