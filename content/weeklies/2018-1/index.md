### 👻 Something completely else

1. [**Have smartphones destroyed a generation?**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/)
2. [**Stop reading self-help books**](https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/why-you-should-read-biographies-to-become-the-greatest-version-of-yourself-not-self-help-books-6373c74475bd)

#### [**Have smartphones destroyed a generation?**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/)

This weeks Completely else is about understanding how smartphones are paving the way to suicide and depression in teenagers. As a developer, designer, or a business creature you should read this and stop to think: are you actually creating something malicious?

#### [**Stop reading self-help books**](https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/why-you-should-read-biographies-to-become-the-greatest-version-of-yourself-not-self-help-books-6373c74475bd)

Everyone knows that feeling of empowerment that self-help books generate. But building a better life for yourself isn’t just about making minor changes to your habits. Instead you should be more holistic and understand the highs and lows of life. This is where reading biographies comes into picture.
