#### First release of our weekly newsletter — let’s see how this goes!

What are we up to this week? What happened last week? Perfektio Weeklies are a light collection of what is happening in our company, what our culture is like, and what types of design and development stuff you should read about this week!

Last week we build some predictive maintance services together with Siemens. Photo courtesy of Industryhack.
