### Design

**[Cross-Cultural Design](https://alistapart.com/article/cross-cultural-design/)**  
Mainly about fonts and type settings, but definitely worth reading

**[Create screenshots for your App Store page](https://previewed.app/screenshots/appstore/)**  
It feels like I've posted this before (or perhaps it was a similar tool). Nevertheless this one is pretty great tool to add to app makes catalogue.

### Tech

**[AuthSession (Expo)](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/auth-session/)**  
Expo recently released AuthSession API, which makes working with Oauth in React Native (and RN-web) a lot easier.

**[How To Identify A Disney Princess](http://seccorecit.blogspot.com/2019/03/umileah-how-to-identify-disney-princess.html)**  
With Regex.

**[react-native-sticky-item](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-sticky-item)**  
Cool little component that mimics the sticky functionality of Facebook stories.

**[Speculating on Animal Crossing Turnip Market](https://insignificantbits.com/2020/05/02/turnips/)**  
Can we come up with a good strategy to sell our turnips?

### BIZ

**[How to sell a B2B product](https://calv.info/how-to-sell-b2b)**  
"In enterprise software, customers pay for software based upon the value that software provides, not the cost to deliver or build that software."

**[Lyft lays off 17% of workforce, furloughs hundreds more](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/lyft-lays-off-17percent-of-workforce-furloughs-hundreds-more.html)**  
Sign of times

### Other

**[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)**  
"This post aspires to be README.txt for your career as a young engineer."

**[Kurt Vonnegut, Shape of Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc)**  
You should read Vonnegut, but before you do that take a look at this video.
