### Business, business, business

**[Bob Iger to step down as Disney CEO, effective immediately](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/25/disney-names-bob-chapek-next-ceo.html)**
This news generatted some waves, but then it turned out that this has actually been the plan for some time now. Iger is to be superseded by, the guy who every Disney park goer hates, Bob Chapek. Why they hate him? Because his "value engineering" has increased the prices of the Disney park rides while at the same time made every feel the same as the last one.

### Personal insights

**Stocks don´t like the taste of corona**
Corona virus swiftly erased 8% of of stock portfolio. With a little waiting it might also open up possibilities in strengthening

**What's up Nyxo?**
Eeva (COO) just shipped out to San Fransisco and will be staying there for a month, with the goal of meeting other enterprenueurs, potential clients, users and learn about the market in general. Meanwhile we just signed a new mobile developer who will be starting from next week. We are now six strong (+ technically also Anu and Liisa). Diversity number are so that 2/6 are women, there are 3 different nationalities, and we have people aged between 21 to 35.

We also got an email from YC that we should apply again because "You were in the top 10% of startups we saw". This doesn't mean much, we've already applied four times before and our changes no better this than the last time: we still aren't from Stanford (or from any other American college), we are not child prodigies, and we don't know any of the YC partners before.
