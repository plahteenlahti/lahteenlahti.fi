_**Weekly collection of links and resources resources I've come across this week. Also some updates about my life, the company I'm building and my investments as well.**_

### Tech

**[Things to build with AWS Lambdas](https://twitter.com/kyleshevlin/status/1235269529694908416)**  
Twitter thread about what to build with Lambdas.

**[How a 2 person startup already uses 28 other tools](https://acrossapp.com/blog/how-a-2-person-startup-already-uses-28-other-tools)**  
It takes surprisingly many tools to run a two person Saas-startup.

**[A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2020/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust/)**  
Learn Rust on your lunch break by reading snippets and their explanations.

**[Distorted Button Effects with SVG Filters](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/05/11/distorted-button-effects-with-svg-filters/)**  
These are cool, but I'm having hard time coming up with a good design to make use of them. Worth reading to learn more about combing CSS filters with SVg filters.

**[Styled-components and display name](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/youre-missing-a-trick-with-your-styled-components-in-react-e3dfcd586f75)**  
Add a display name to your components to help identify them

### Design

**[Starting a design system in a start-up](https://uxdesign.cc/starting-a-design-system-in-a-start-up-3359f2d4784b)**  
Worth reading when your startup hires its first designers. Not worth your time if you're three person startup.

**[Animated PictoGrams for Tokyo Olympics](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/tokyo-2020-olympic-paralympic-kinetic-sport-pictograms-animation-260220)**  
These are cool as hell.

**[React Links for Designers](https://react.design/links/)**  
Useful for developers of course as well.

**[BMW has a new logo](https://www.bmw.com/en/automotive-life/bmw-logo-meaning-history1.html)**  
History of the BMW logo. Btw it was never a propeller.

### Business, business, business

**[\$75M legal startup Atrium shuts down](https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/atrium-shuts-down/)**  
Turns out previous success isn't a predictor of future success even when you're solving a real problem. The founder of Atrium, Justin Kan, previously founded a company that eventually turned into Twitch. Atrium however was a traditional law firm with VC money, trying to make it easier for founders to avoid bad terms sheet etc.

**[The Weirdest Shit to Come Out of Silicon Valley in February](https://thebolditalic.com/the-weirdest-shit-to-come-out-of-silicon-valley-in-february-5fea47b59bad)**  
The Weirdest Shit to Come Out of Silicon Valley in February

### Other stuff

**Upcoming: two new blog posts**  
Currently in the process of finishing the editing on a blog post about "How many founders should a startup have". In addition to late last night while commuting home I started writing a new post about hiring passionate people. Both should be out in few days.

**Having a really tough week**
Lots of things aren't going the way I would want them to go. Everything that is happening is pushing me to cancel my weekend plans to sort out problems, which is a shame as I was looking forward doing something else this weekend than working. Quite sure I haven't had a free weekend in 7 months. But I might still just say "fuck it" and not work at all during the weekend, which would be quite radical. Let's see. Life spent overworked is pretty meaningless life after all.
