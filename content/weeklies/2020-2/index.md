### Personal insights

**Two new blog posts**  
I released two new blog posts this week. One is the transcript of my talk at React Day Berlin last December, which I actually wrote already a month ago, but didn't have time to review. There's just something about listening yourself talk and noticing all the tiny mistakes. Using Yotube's auto subtitles (and the export feature) really helped in making this transcript.

Second I wrote a small article about fixing a common warning you get when you nest a virtualized list inside a ScrollView in React Native. I made a test post about it last week and from Google alone that article brought 5% increase in visitors. Seems that I'm not the only one with this problem.

**What's up Nyxo?**  
I've been building an improved subscription view so buying the coaching should get easier in the future. Also I'm planning on a major rewrite of the way we store sleep data. Our teams has also been working on bringing the coaching material freely available on [nyxo.app](https://nyxo.app). We are hopefully releasing this feature on friday.

Also, I'm hoping to open source the mobile app in three months, blog post about this coming soon.

**Compounding drama**  
I've recently noticed that everyone but me seems to be living that high-drama life that gets a lot of likes and retweets. What is more interesting is that engaging in drama works like compound interest. Posting one good tweet about how you grew up poor will possibly net you a decent amount of followers who will in the future engage with your future content and net you more followers. Similar thing happens with quality content, but the requires one to invest more time in creating that.
